## cppwinrt Demo 2 ##
This is a demo experimenting the WinRT abi with WRL (Windwos Runtime Template Library), C++/CX (the C++ dialect easing the use of WinRT components with smart pointers) and cppwinrt

cppwinrt is a Microsoft project created by Kenny Kerr that use just the standard ISO C++ to wrap the WinRT component management.
The result is even simpler than C++/CX or C# projections
The project can be found here:
https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt

In order to make this demo work, you should first clone the cppwinrt project and then modify the "additional include folders" with the cloned repo.
